# Distinct Happy Number Range Counter

This was largely a project simply for the purpose of allowing me to test using GO. It has largely the same functionality as [another repo](https://github.com/jjmark15/happy-numbers) of mine.

For information on happy numbers please see [the wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number).

## Install

To install the cli please run `install.sh`.
